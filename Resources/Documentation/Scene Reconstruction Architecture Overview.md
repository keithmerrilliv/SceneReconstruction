# Scene Reconstruction Architecture Overview

## System Components

The Scene Reconstruction system is built on four core Apple frameworks:

1. **RealityKit Object Capture** - Captures 3D objects from multiple images
2. **CoreImage** - Processes RAW image data for lighting analysis  
3. **Vision** - Provides contextual understanding of scenes and lighting conditions
4. **Metal** - Renders Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials with realistic lighting
